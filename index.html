            I am a student of Computer Science at Portland State University as
            of March of 2023, and I am expecting to graduate within this year.
            Within this website are going to be details about what I have
            accomplished during my time here, which can be found clicking around
            the top part of this site. These include projects and skills learned
            through classes taken!
          </p>
          <p class="intro-fun">
            Aside from Computer Science, I enjoy eating good food (and cooking
            it, sometimes), as well as drinking coffee (with or without creamer
            and sugar) and playing games!
