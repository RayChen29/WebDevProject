          Part of Portland State University's Computer Science education hinges
          on being assigned projects to implement in some way. Here are 3 such
          projects that have left me better prepared for the future that you may
          click on in order to go to its respective repository on GitHub.

            <span>CS300 - JavaScript Space Game</span>
            For our project in Professor Harrison's class, my group was given a
            skeleton of a game written in HTML and JavaScript, where we would
            implement a set number of requested features; this project was meant
            to help practice working as a group utilizing GitHub and Scrum
            Meetings together,though this also became a decent source of
            exposure to HTML and JavaScript, even without full understanding to
            what it was at the time.

            <span> CS445 - Python Machine Learning Traffic Project </span>
            For Professor Rhode's class, our group would train a model using a
            dataset on the passengers of the Titanic in order to predict if,
            given a passenger's name, passenger class, gender, and age, they
            would survive. Data had to be cleaned up however, which we did by
            filling in any blanks with random values, such as random age based
            on the age range up of the dataset, and a randomly assigned gender.
